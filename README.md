# Simple maps using React   

The idea behind this project is to learn building custom responsive maps which includes features such as zooming in/out, creating a fully customisable custom marker, etc.

Technologies used so far: 
- ReactJS (For building the UI elements).
- ChromaJS(To spread the color over a range of values).
- Netlify (To deploy)


### TO DO: 

- [x] Create a map and simulate it.
- [x] Create a graph for the same datapoints and display it below the map.
- [ ] Integrate ExpressJS and make it a MERN stack project.
- [ ] Implement a search feature for adding any new place.
- [ ] Deploy the project.
